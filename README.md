# TumorDetection
**For an in-depth analysis of this project -->** [Tumor Detection Analysis](https://sinclairhansen.github.io/tumorDetection.html)


Language: Python

Libraries: PyTorch, timm, matplotlib, numpy, and pandas.

This program utilizes thousands of MRI scans to train a model that sorts images into four types of tumors: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. This project will be presented at the STEAM @ Schoolcraft conference to show how AI is being used to advance the medical field in disease detection. 


Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is innovating the medical field by diagnosing diseases earlier, offering personalized treatment to patients, and reducing error in hospitals. This research explores the application of AI in tumor detection through the development of a machine learning-based program capable of identifying different types of tumors in MRI scans. The program is designed to assist doctors in identifying tumors quicker with lower error rates. The program also shows how effortless it is to make a positive impact on our medical care using AI.
